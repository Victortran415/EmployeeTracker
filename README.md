  # Employee_Tracker

  ## Description:
  For this application, I've created an interface that makes it easy for Users such as business owners or management team to view information as well as storing data into the database. This application will be using node.js so users will be viewing and editing information through the command-line. Users will be able to view employees based on departments, roles or all together. They will also be able to add departments, roles, employee, and update status of an employee if needed.

  ## Installation:
  To create this application, you would have to run `npm install` which will provide you a npm dependencies such as node_modules & package.json. However, if users only need to install package.json they can run `npm init -y` on the command-line. 
  - `inquirer` will capture user response in the command-line 
  - `mySQL` a database management system
  - `console.table` similar to console.log however console.log will put data into a table
